### Project Description

With this Quiz App you can play through multiple categories of Science such as Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics (and much more to come) to increase your knowledge on various subjects of science.

### Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* XML


<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->

On the Home Screen the user can enter their username that will be tracked throughout the app and the username will also be stored so that the user don't have to enter their name everytime the open the app.

### Categories Screen

On this screen there is cards containing the different categories that can be played and also the High Score of each category that is displayed just underneath the High Score text. The number that is in percentage shows the completion rate of the total number of questions answered for example if the user answered 2 out of 10 questions the percentage will be 20 etc. When the user clicks on of the categories they will be taken to the questions screen.

### Question Screen

Starting at the top there is a pink progress line that will get longer to visually indicate to the user how far they are with all the questions of the selected category. Next to the left just underneath the progress line there will be text to tell the user how far they are and how many questions there are in total. To the right it will show the user how much points they accumulated so far. There is two types of questions: A questions where a user will need to type their answer, this answer can be given as a string or integer depending on the question. The next type of question is multiple choice, here a list of possible answers will be dynamically generated for each question and when the user selects one it will go to the next question.

### Result Screen

The result screen will display your score and also have a button so that you can play the category again if you want to. If you did not get a High Score all the questions that was presented in the chosen category will be displayed with the correct answer to each question.

If you do beat your high score the screen will look a bit different. All that will change is the message that you get telling you that you got a newer high score.

### Info Screen

The Info screen does not really have any information. It gives a little bit of information about the app and about the developer of the app that is me. This screen also has a link to my github.

### Settings Screen

The settings screen is only there for the user to reset their high score on all categories. This will clear their high score and their completion rate for each category.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* One of the highlights that I really enjoyed was the Splash Screen as it was simple but was really effective in grabbing the users attention.  
* Changing how the question screen looks depending on the type of question it is. It was done by assigning a type value to each question and if the type question is "Input" the screen will just provide a input field and next button but when the type is "Multiple" it will dynamically populate all the possible options as a RadioGroup.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* One of the bugs that I faced was when I wanted to see if the user got a higher score than they previously had. In the end it was just a simple error of using the wrong variables to compare to the previous high score.


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Google Ad Implementation
* Starting off you need to add a AdView layout to your screen where will give the adSize such as Banner or one of the other types supplied by adMob. Next you give the adView the unitId, this will tell ad network where to send ads when they are requested. After setting this information on each view. On the Kotlin side you will Initialise the ad by requesting a ad and then load the ad to the view.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* In the future I would like to update some of the UI of the app.
* Implementing levels within each category that will be from the easiest questions to the hardest.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
